# ToyChessEngine
Creating my own tiny toy chess engine for fun... and to learn more about chess programming :)

Using the dataset from Global Hack Week: Games to teach an AI to play chess!






### To Do:
1) Make a better ML model. Train a model to play chess by evaluating how good a board state is.
2) Web-app interface using streamlit
3) Build an actual chess engine. [ref1 Andrew Healey's Blog](https://healeycodes.com/building-my-own-chess-engine)
